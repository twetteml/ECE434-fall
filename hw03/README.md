Homework 3 - Madeline Twetten

--TMP101--
Created temp.py which runs and displays the temperature of the two 
temperature sensors in the terminal window. Once the alert pin recognizes
that the sensors are reading over/under limits, a message is displayed.

--Etch a Sketch--
Created EtchASketch.py which uses the rotary encoders and the 8x8 LED
matrix to display the pattern being etched. Press buttons 1 and 4 at the
same time to erase the matrix and stop the program.
